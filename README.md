## Divotion assessment

Build a basic Product Listing Page, showing some fake products originating from a JSON file of your own creation.

Add a“wishlist” widget that allows adding/removing products on the wishlist. Wishlist items should have a quantity that can be changed. Wishlist items should persist between browser sessions.

The page should have a header with a company logo and a “favorites” icon. The favorites icon should have a badge showing the number of items currently on the wishlist, much like a shopping cart on a webshop that is showing the number of items in the cart.

The wishlist itself should be presented in a “side panel” which can be opened by clicking the “favorites” icon in the header. The side panel should overlay the Product Listing Page.

And finally; think outside the box. This is an invitation to showcase your craftsmanship and creativity, to show what’s important to you, and we like to be technically surprised. 

In case you have any questions regarding this case please feel free to contact Mathijs or Sanne.
